      Up on Scorpion Hill, watchin' life passin' me by in the pale moonlight. And I sat there forever, three sheets to the wind. It's not helpin' my case - the state that I'm in - but it's not how they told you. My intentions were good. I was burstin' apart like the end of the ark, holding on to whatever I could.<br><br>
      
      A square of light moves its way through the empty room, across the stained carpet like a ghost of myself in the afternoon haunting my basement apartment. I looked in the mirror hangin' behind my door. <u>The glass was cracked, and the man staring back, he didn't look like me anymore.</u> And if the world is gonna burn, everyone should get a turn to light it up. Down and out, I've been on the rocks. I've been havin' some pretty dark thoughts. I like them a lot.<br><br>
      
      Time and time again, well, I've tried and failed to get my act together. And I'll admit: lately, things really went off the rails. I know that you deserve better. Then in the morning, as I was boarding the commuter train to work, the boss was calling. He said, "<b>There's been cutbacks, and I'm sorry, you're the first.</b>" And if I can't support the two of us, how can I support a third? Down and out, I've been on the rocks. I've been having some pretty dark houghts, and I'm on the brink, falling into debt, falling into drink. I can drown those regrets; I don't have to think.<br><br>
      
      Now I'm workin' the night shift, asleep at the wheel. I was burstin' apart like a flame from a spark, thinkin', <i>Jesus, this can't be for real!</i><br><br>
      
      My sweat-soaked mattress, corner of the room; cigarettes and matches in the fading afternoon; and a picture of my kid. Yeah, he's smiling. It's the first day of school.<br><br>
      
      She said, "<b>I found the gun. It was buried beneath the piles of clothes in the room where your son sleeps.</b>" And I can't pretend to know how this will end.
